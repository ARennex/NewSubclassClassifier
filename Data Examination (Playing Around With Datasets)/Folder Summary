These folders are various plots of properties against each other, taken from various samples and crossmatchings of Carlos's Viva Catalogue. The Long Period Red Stars, High Certainty Stars, High Amp Stars Testing and Early Red Variable Testing were around the time I figured out that the periods of carlos's objects might not be entirely accurate for many objects.

Crossmatched Data includes some tests based on variable type. It was here that I learned that many of the OGLE sourced objects would likely be saturated in VVV - leading to larger than normal amplitudes (>4 Ks mags for OSARGs)
